I am a demographer interested in the statistical measurement and analysis of determinants of harmful practices in Latin America. My research interests include closing gaps in the measurement of the Sustainable Development Goals and generating evidence for decision-making in public policy and management. I have had work experience with the public sector and the United Nations.
